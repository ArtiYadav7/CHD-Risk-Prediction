Purpose:
In this project we are going to develop a model that could predict which person are more likely to have a risk of coronory heart disease in next 10 years. We are going to explore the data and then create a model to predict how likely the person get a heart disease.




Summary of the Project:
The dataset contains 3390 observations with 17 features.

The target variable is "TenYearCHD", which is a binary variable indicating whether patient will get coronory heart disease in next ten year or not.

The goal of the project is to develop a model to predict patients who might get CHD and identify key factors contributing to Heart Disease

The project will involve exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and building and evaluating machine learning models.

Potential benefits of the project include improved peoples health condition.
